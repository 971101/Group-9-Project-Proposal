On January 20th, 2014, a corporate meeting is held to celebrate the new-found fortune because of the initial public offering of the company. However, a series of rare events occur that lead to the disappearance of several employees. The Protectors of Kronos (POK), a social movement organization that has been fighting against water contamination and government corruption, is suspected in the disappearance.\r\nAs analysts, we were assigned with several tasks in order to identify risks and how they could have been mitigated more effectively.\r\nObjective\r\nTasks are\r\nDistinguish meaningful event reports from typical chatter from junk or spam.\r\nEvaluate the level of the risk to the public evolves over the course of the evening. Consider the potential consequences of the situation and the number of people who could be affected.\r\nDetermine the appropriate location for first responders.\r\nThe differences between dealing with this challenge in 2014 and dealing with it now.\r\n2.0 Data Source\r\nThe data source is from Vast Challenge 2021.. The data has\r\nMicroblog records that have been identified by automated filters as being potentially relevant to the ongoing incident.\r\nText transcripts of emergency dispatches by the Abila, Kronos local police and fire departments.\r\nMaps of Abila and Kronos Island.\r\n3.0 The overall procedure.\r\nThe overall procedure is depicted in the picture.\r\n\r\nThe task one\r\nWe will use keywords, posting authors and other relevant information to identify meaningful information and spam information. We also compare the records of the police and fire department to verify if it is valid information. We would like to use two ways to show the results.\r\nUsing word cloud present key words of meaningful post and junk post.\r\nUsing histogram or bar chart present the words features(like sentence length) of meaningful and junk post.\r\nThe task two\r\nWe will ranking risks from level 1 to level 5 according to the severity. Level 5 is the most serious.\r\nThis is the original thought of visualization.\r\n\r\nThe task three\r\nWe would like to compare the map and event information to show events took place in which area of the island.\r\n\r\nAnd then we want to use cluster model(variables: time, latitude, longitude and risk level) to classify events.\r\nThe task four\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
