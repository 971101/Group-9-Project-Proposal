On January 20th, 2014, a corporate meeting is held to celebrate the new-found fortune because of the initial public offering of the company. However, a series of rare events occur that lead to the disappearance of several employees. The Protectors of Kronos (POK), a social movement organization that has been fighting against water contamination and government corruption, is suspected in the disappearance.\r\nAs analysts, we were assigned with several tasks in order to identify risks and how they could have been mitigated more effectively.\r\nObjective\r\nUsing data and visual analytics to evaluate the changing levels of risk to the public and recommend actions for first responder:\r\nDistinguish meaningful event reports from typical chatter from junk or spam.\r\nEvaluate the level of the risk to the public evolves over the course of the evening. Consider the potential consequences of the situation and the number of people who could be affected.\r\nDetermine the appropriate location for first responders.\r\nThe differences between dealing with this challenge in 2014 and dealing with it now.\r\n2.0 Data Source\r\nThe data source is from Vast Challenge 2021.. The data has\r\nMicroblog records that have been identified by automated filters as being potentially relevant to the ongoing incident.\r\nText transcripts of emergency dispatches by the Abila, Kronos local police and fire departments.\r\nGeospatial data and map of Abila and Kronos Island.\r\nMa and background documents.\r\n3.0 The overall procedure.\r\nThe overall procedure is depicted in the picture.\r\n\r\nThe task one\r\nUsing basic feature of junk and meaningful records in microblog to conduct initial identification and classification.\r\nCompare the records of the police and fire department to classify false posts and valid event records, further improving features extraction.\r\nClassify meaningful record and junk.\r\nTwo methods would be used to present to identify significant record and junk:\r\nUsing word cloud present key words of meaningful post and junk post.\r\nUsing histogram or bar chart present the words features(like sentence length) of meaningful and junk post.\r\nThe task two\r\nMeaningful Record after validation would be used in task 2.\r\nLabel event with risk involved which ranking from level 1 to level 5 according to its influence and severity. And level 5 is the most serious.\r\nUsing regular expression to extract the number of people involved in events.\r\nThe distribution of event with multiple risks would be presented over the course of the evening.\r\nThe original thought of visualization is below:\r\n\r\nThe task three\r\nMeaningful Record after validation would be used in task 3.\r\nIntegrating geospatial data to present the location of events with various risks.\r\nClustering events based on variables ‘Time’, ‘Latitude’, ‘Longitude’ and risk level to show event distributions with some same features.\r\nThe original thought of visualization is below:\r\n\r\nThe task four\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
